Simon game

The logic of the game is as follows:
First, any of the buttons are blinking. For example, the yellow button for level 1 flashed. 
Then, at Level 2, the red button flashed. Then you have to complete the level 2 by pressing the yellow button first and then the red button. 
If the green button flashes in Level 3; first you have to press the button in level 1, then the button in level 2 and then the button in level 3. 

In other words, you have to move forward by keeping the flashing buttons in the previous levels in mind.

For example ;
To pass level 4:
Level 1 button then Level 2 button then Level 3 Button and Level 4 Button must be pressed.

IF ;
Level 1 : YELLOW
Level 2 : RED
Level 3 : GREEN
Level 4 : RED

To pass level 4 :
You need to click YELLOW-RED-GREEN-RED .
